This is the AlgoExpert Contest Submission for Matthew Cintron

The project was built in 40 days using Unity and is coded primarily in C#
It was inspired by the original unity star fighter 2D game and is basically a massively upgraded version of that game

Main Upgrades
The game now has a full physics controlled 3D star fighter ship piloted using the WASD or arrow keys
You have a primary and secondary fire space bar for primary fire and B for Bombs 
Enemy’s track your movements and return fire with their own weapons
you have a shield that will regenerate and a ship health that will not
and last you have a radar system on your lower right that tracks enemy ship movements in your area

The code is broken down into major elements of the game Player, Game Manager, Enemy’s and Radar
 and included in the git is the executable project demo so you can play the game for yourself

Enjoy and Thanks for making this contest
